        The Speedplay Zero Pedal System is renowned for its superior adjustability over other pedal systems and is packed with performance features. The Speedplay Zero Stainless Custom Width Pedals are lightweight, at only 103 grams per pedal and a low stack height of 11.5 mm (8.5mm for four-hole mounting) places your foot closer to the pedal for efficient power transfer.

        The dual-sided entry makes clipping in a breeze - you can just step down into the cleat with no need to look down or fumble to get your foot clipped in. As the locking mechanism doesn't rely on spring tension to keep you secure, entry and exit are easy, but accidental release is rare.

        The pedal profile is thinner than most, thanks to three precision cartridge and needle bearings, giving you extra clearance when cornering and reduced drag. The inverted design, with the cleat providing the platform rather than the pedal, ensures a solid connection when clipped in.

        Unlike other systems, the three axis adjustments - fore-aft, side-to-side, and rotational foot positions - can be set independently and rotational float can be set between zero and 15 degrees.

        This Speedplay Zero pedal system is offered in four different spindle lengths (50mm, 56mm, 59mm, 65mm) to cater for those riders who need a wider or narrower stance to ensure proper hip and knee alignment.

        Please note: Zero Aero Walkableâ„¢ Cleats are compatible with all Speedplay Zero Pedals. Zero pedals are not compatible with Speedplay Ultra Light Action and X-Series cleats. Zero cleats fit any shoe with a three-hole or four-hole mount.

        Please note: Speedplay also offer a Light Action range of Zero pedals, which might be preferable for lighter riders (around 60kg or less), as they require less force to engage the cleat with the pedal. To browse the full range of Speedplay Zero pedals, click this link.
