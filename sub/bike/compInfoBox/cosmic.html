        Mavic describe their 2019 Cosmic Ultimate Tubular Wheelset as the Formula One of road racing wheels, and for good reason. Combining incredible stiffness and heightened aerodynamics, these featherweight wheels have been proven in the UCI World Tour by the sport’s top athletes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The unidirectional carbon spokes eliminate flex through stretching, while their design runs directly from the edge of the rim to that of the hub, boosting stiffness and aerodynamics immensely. An asymmetric rear rim balances spoke tension, meaning the wheel can withstand the heaviest lateral loads during sprints and attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rims have been moulded entirely from carbon fibre to reduce weight, while their 25mm width allows a perfect fit with 25mm tyres. At 40mm deep the rims also strike the sweet spot between aerodynamic efficiency and cross-wind stability, ideal for all day riding.

    <p>    
        Finished with Mavic’s unique iTgMax Technology, the Cosmic's provide optimal braking performance in both the wet and dry, while the thin carbon hub flanges further cut weight.
