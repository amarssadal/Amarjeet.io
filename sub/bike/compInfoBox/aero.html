        Optimise your aerodynamic profile with the Trek Madone XXX Integrated Bar/Stem KVF Aero Handlebar. The KVF (Kammtail Virtual Foil) design of the bars minimises drag dramatically be reducing the frontal surface area of the bar. The KVF shape also reduces turbulence around the back of the bar, which creates greater stability at speed.

    <p>
        The 100% carbon fibre construction integrates internal cable routing that is compatible with electronic or mechanical gearing. The carbon fibre construction not only reduces weight, it also increases torsional and lateral rigidity. This added stiffness makes for a more responsive riding experience and greater power generation when pulling on the bars in a sprint.

        Available in a range of widths and stem lengths, the Trek Madone XXX Integrated Bar/Stem KVF Aero Handlebar are finished in a stealthy Dnister Black colour scheme.
