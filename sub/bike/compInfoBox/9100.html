        At the top of Shimano’s range of pedals sits the PD-R9100, but this version, the Shimano Dura-Ace 9100 Carbon SPD SL Road Pedals - 4mm Longer Axle, comprises of a 4mm longer axle for riders who need extra width due to knee strain or injuries. These pedals still hold and the performance benefits you yearn for when laying down the power, and that's exactly what the wide and shallow carbon fibre platform lets you do when you’re sprinting out the saddle.

        Constructed with a lightweight carbon fibre body, these pedals offer a large shoe contact area to maximise power transfer and support. Stainless steel pedal body plates increase durability whilst also creating a solid contact point between your cleat and the pedal.

        The low profile 8.8mm body height from axle centre to cleat contact surface provides greater cornering clearance while the open design allows for easy access to cleat adjustment.
