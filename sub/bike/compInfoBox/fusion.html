        The Hutchinson Fusion 5 Galactik 11 Storm Tubeless Tyre Bundle consists of two fast-rolling lightweight clincher tyres that can be set up tubeless for further comfort at speed and fewer punctures. At just 240 grams per tyre (25mm width), this is a lightweight composition that enjoys the benefits of Hutchinson's unique ElevenSTORM compound for long-lasting performance. Grippy and responsive, this is a fast tyre that boasts a good level of longevity. As a set of tubeless-ready clinchers, the tyres can be set up with inner tubes, or optimised with sealant and compatible rims to run a lower pressure tubeless setup with fewer punctures.
