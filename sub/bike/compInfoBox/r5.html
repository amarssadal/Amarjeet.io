    <p>In 2017 the cobble-inspired R5 appeared on the Pro tour to critical acclaim. And when the wrap came off the fans made it loud and clear that we needed to bring it back.</p>
    <p>The R5 makes no compromises as an ultralight race machine first and foremost. Team Dimension Data’s world tour riders also praise its new pro fit, stable and responsive handling, and unrivalled stiffness. No wonder Bernie Eisel calls it “the perfect bike for stage racing," with Omar Fraile demonstrating as much by powering it to glory in the 100th Giro d’Italia.</p>
    <p>Premium road performance.</p>
    <p>The ultimate all-round race machine deserves optimal component packages to maximize performance, and the R5 delivers. A revamped handling geometry balances stability and responsiveness for a ride experience that will make your confidence soar and your rivals curse.</p>
    <p>The Cervelo R5 Classics Limited Edition Frameset brings together a lightweight and stiff carbon fibre layup and highly responsive handling, all wrapped in a graphic paint job inspired by the pave sections of the spring classics.</p>

    <p>There's a lot to like in this frameset, especially if you're a traditionalist. While the All-Carbon R5 frame is built with Cervelo's premium grade carbon fibre and handles the way a modern racing bike should, it's got a classic shape by modern standards and comes ready for mounting rim brakes. The carbon seatpost aids in vibration damping, so you stay in complete comfort while attacking the bunch or upon reaching the tenth town sign of an epic day out.</p>

    FEATURES:
    <li>21% stiffer at the head tube, 13% stiffer at the bottom bracket compared to the previous R5</li>
    <li>New handling geometry</li>
    <li>Squoval tubing for strength</li>
    <li>Includes Cervélo Carbon SP18 Seatpost</li>
