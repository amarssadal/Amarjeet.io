        With an incredibly low rolling resistance, super light weight and tubeless compatibility, the Corsa Speed G2.0 TLR Clincher Road Tyre from Vittoria was built with one purpose in mind: racing. This race day special uses GRAPHENE 2.0 compound paired with Corespun-T casing to achieve its ultra-low rolling resistance and suppleness. In its tubeless ready iteration, small punctures and holes will seal however it is by no means a tyre that is designed for serious mileage.
