        Benefit from Zipp's restless innovation with the 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Tubeless 6-Bolt Disc Wheelset. With a number of key features, this wheelset is a performance-oriented upgrade that will improve the ride quality and performance of most disc brake framesets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the rims don't require a braking surface, Zipp's Aerodynamic Boundary Layer Control (ABLC) dimples can extend all the way to the outer edge, providing even better aerodynamic performance, especially in a crosswind.
    </p>

    <p>    
        The internal 21mm rim width is the perfect platform for wider tyres, bringing additional comfort on less-than-perfect road surfaces. The wheelset was designed to be used with tubeless tyres, but can easily accommodate clincher tyres with tubes too.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Firecrest 303's lightweight rim design excels at accelerating and climbing while the 77D and 177D hubs feature best-in-class durability, with fewer requirements for maintenance. This highly compatible wheelset comes supplied with both quick release and 15mm thru-axle end caps.
