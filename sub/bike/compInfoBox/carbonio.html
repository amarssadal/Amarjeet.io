        This full-fit carbon-shelled throne stays stiff and sturdy in all the right places to give unrivalled support as you hunt for road racing glory. A dip in the rear section keeps your lumbar area protected when sitting deep, with each side of your pelvis staying well supported for enhanced pedal stroke performance.

        The saddle-shape narrows towards the nose, allowing for superb thigh clearance, with the rounded tip area offering great climbing control and power transfer at critical points of your run. Rounding out this Carbonio saddle are super-light, firm-holding Carbo-Keramic rails and a smooth-movement Fibra-Tek cover, letting you move around the saddle surface with the utmost confidence and composure on your fight for first place.
